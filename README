## Description

More details coming soon.

## Build Instructions

```bash
git clone git@github.com:woodrowbarlow/nickleback.git
cd nickleback

// this will download sources for all third-party packages so you can build offline
// (optional, this gets done anyway when you run make)
make source

// this builds the image
make

// if you modify the nickleback source code, you need to rebuild the package
make nickleback-rebuild
// then make the image again
make
```
